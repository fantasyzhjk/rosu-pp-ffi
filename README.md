# rosu-pp-ffi

**rosu-pp-ffi** is a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) implementation for the [rosu-pp](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp) library. It provides an efficient way to integrate osu! performance points calculation into other programming languages.

## Features

- Access to rosu-pp's performance points calculation methods via FFI.
- Support for integration with multiple languages.
- Simple and lightweight design for cross-platform compatibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (for building the FFI library). Install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- A C-compatible compiler for your platform.

### Usage

Clone and Build the library:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fantasyzhjk/rosu-pp-ffi.git
cd rosu-pp-ffi
cargo build --release
```

Link the resulting library to your project according to your programming languageâ€™s FFI guidelines.

### C# Usage

To use this library in a C# project, you can add it as a Git submodule and reference the `RosuPP.csproj` directly in your `.csproj` file:

1. Add the repository as a Git submodule:

    ```bash
    git submodule add https://github.com/fantasyzhjk/rosu-pp-ffi.git
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2. In your .csproj file, add the following reference to include the library as a dependency:

    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
        <ProjectReference Include="./rosu-pp-ffi/SharpRosuPP/RosuPP/RosuPP.csproj" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

For detailed usage examples, refer to the official [rosu-pp documentation](https://docs.rs/rosu-pp/) and language-specific bindings.
